# SpyWitch
### Overview:

An open source tool to track users on twitch.tv

> I created this tool to help twitch channel moderators. Sometimes it is necessary to track some chatters closely, depending on the situation. By using this tool, you can now follow those users closely and be aware of their general behavior on the platform.

### How to use:
